asp.net-clientside
==================

**ASP.NET high level framework for creating and running familiar controls client-side, plus high level client-side MVC framework**

*This is my concept. IPR copyright 31 July 2012 Alan Oliver. I do not have the opportunity to develop this myself due to advanced terminal cancer, but perhaps a team-developed solution could become my legacy? Are there any takers out there?*

I have been tinkering around to keep my mind active whilst my cancer progresses, and I have been amazed by the power of HTML5 and JavaScript as supported by advanced browsers such as Google Chrome v21.  I have undertaken some relatively junior developments in ASP.NET (up to Web Forms 4.5 RC), and can see an opportunity to provide an option to translate many of the existing ASP.NET controls into the client-side for faster and more responsive operation, with client-side API hooks. XHR2 and Web Sockets provide a powerful mechanism that could be used to couple them invisibly to the into server-side layer.

Furthermore I have been looking at the power and neatness of client-side JavaScript frameworks such as Ember.js and AngularJS. I am disappointed and amazed at the sprawling code required to implement solutions. As demonstrated by the [TodoMVC project](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/); just compare the MVC framework implementations with the vanilla JavaScript version and you'll witness what I mean. Yes, the MVC versions are more structured and extensible, but they sprawl and would benefit from a high-level language/framework/wrapper running on the client-side.

I can see an enormous opportunity here, but I don't believe I have sufficient time to learn how to develop frameworks and undertake this myself. I spent my younger professional life working my way up from assembly language developer up to development department manager of various disciplines ending up with large scale web development. Today's frameworks blow my mind, and the HTML5 suite of page markup, ECMAScript5, CSS3, etc, are very exciting. 

Would anyone like to take the challenge and make us millions?!
